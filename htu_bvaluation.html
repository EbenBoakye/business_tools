    <h2>How to Use The Business Valuation Calculator</h2>
    <div id="widget-container">
            <p>My Business Valuation Calculator is a simple and effective tool that helps you estimate the value of your business over time.
               Follow these steps to calculate your business's worth today and in the future:</p> <br>
            <h3> <b>1: Enter Your Business's Operating Profit (Â£)</b></h3>
            <p>The operating profit is the profit your business makes from its core operations. 
               It is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) and operating expenses from the revenue. 
               Enter the current annual operating profit of your business in the input field provided.</p>
            <h3><b> 2: Enter Your Expected Annual Growth Rate (%)</b></h3>
            <p>All Businesses are valued based on their future earning potential.
                This is the percentage rate at which you expect your business's operating profit to grow each year.
                Example: If you believe your business will grow at a rate of 10% per year, enter 10 into the expected annual growth rate input field provided.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 3: Enter the Number of Years You Expect to Grow at That Rate</b></h3>
            <p>As mentioned, businesses are valued based on their future earning potential. 
                This is the number of years over which you expect the business to grow at the specified rate. 
                This will help estimate the future value of your business.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 4: Get Your Valuation</b></h3>
            <p>Click the "Get Your Valuation" button to calculate the estimated value of your business based on the provided inputs.
                 The valuation will be displayed on the chart along with the current value of your business.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 5: Analyze the Valuation Chart</b></h3>
            <p>The valuation chart will display the current value of your business and the estimated value over the specified number of years.
                You can analyze the growth trajectory of your business and make informed decisions based on the valuation.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 6: Download Your Valuation</b></h3>
            <p>Click the "<i>Download</i> " button to download the valuation chart as an image for your records or presentations.</p>
            <h3><b>Additional Notes!!</b></h3>
            <p><b>Valuation Model:</b> The calculator uses a standard valuation method where the business is estimated to be worth a multiple of its operating profit (default multiple is 5). 
                This multiple can vary depending on the industry and market conditions. </p>
            <p> <b>Growth Assumptions:</b>The calculator assumes consistent growth based on the expected annual growth rate you enter.
                 If your business experiences fluctuations in growth, the actual future value may differ.</p>
