    <h2>How to Use The Revenue Growth Calculator</h2>
    <div id="widget-container">
        <p>The revenue growth rate calculator can give your business an inside look at its forecasted growth over the next few days,
             weeks, months, or years. With the help of simple formula sequences, growth rate and revenue projection tool assesses your previous financial data,
              like current revenue increase or decrease, to estimate your future growth potential. Here's how to use it:</p>
              <h3><b>Step 1: Set Your Current Revenue (£).</b></h3>
                <p>Enter your current revenue in the input field provided. 
                    This is the revenue your business has generated in the current period.</p>
                <h3><b>Step 2: Choose Your Revenue Period.</b></h3>
                <p>Select the period for which you want to calculate the revenue growth. 
                    This could be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. 
                    Select the revenue period from the dropdown menu provided.</p>
                <h3><b>Step 3: Enter the Number of Periods for Estimation.</b></h3>
                <p>Enter the number of periods for which you want to estimate the revenue growth. 
                    This will help calculate the projected revenue over the specified period.</p>
                <h3><b>Step 4: Choose Your Growth Type.</b></h3>
                <p>Select the type of growth rate you want to apply to your revenue. 
                    This could be a static growth rate or a dynamic growth rate. 
                    Choose the growth type from the dropdown menu provided.</p>
                <h3><b>Step 5: Enter Your Predicted Growth Rate Percentage (%).</b></h3>
                <p>Enter the predicted growth rate percentage for your revenue. 
                    If you have a static growth rate, enter a single percentage.
                    If you have a dynamic growth rate, enter growth rates equal to the estimation length.</p>
                   <p> This will help calculate the projected revenue over the specified period.</p>
                <h3><b>Step 6: Calculate Your Revenue Growth.</b></h3>
                <p>Click the "<i>Calculate</i>" button to calculate the projected revenue growth based on the provided inputs. 
                    The calculator will display the results in the output section.</p>
                <h3><b>Step 7: Download Your Revenue Growth Chart.</b></h3>
                <p>Click the "<i>Download Graph</i>" button to download the revenue growth chart as an image for your records or presentations.</p>
                <h3><b>Example Calculation:</b></h3>
                <p>Let’s say you have an <b>ARR of £465,000</b>, a current <b>MRR of £50,000</b>, and a monthly growth rate of <b>5%</b>.
                     This means that your growth for the next month will be <b>£50,000 + 5%*£50,000</b>, totaling a monthly revenue of <b>£52,500</b>.
                      The calculator will use this new value to determine the revenue growth for month 3, which will be: <b>£55,125</b>.</p>
                      <h3><b>Additional Notes!!</b></h3>
                        <p>To make sure your estimated growth percentages are correct for the chosen time period, you can use the following formulas:</p>
                        <p><b>Static Growth Rate:</b> <i>Future Value = Current Value * (1 + Growth Rate)^Number of Periods</i></p>
                        <p><b>Dynamic Growth Rate:</b> <i>Future Value = Current Value * (1 + Growth Rate1) * (1 + Growth Rate2) * ... * (1 + Growth RateN)</i></p>
                        <p>Where <i>Future Value</i> is the projected revenue, <i>Current Value</i> is the current revenue, <i>Growth Rate</i> is the percentage increase in revenue, and <i>Number of Periods</i> is the number of periods for estimation.</p>
                        <p>Remember, the revenue growth calculator is a tool to help you estimate your future revenue based on your current revenue and growth rate assumptions. 
                            Actual revenue growth may vary based on market conditions, competition, and other factors like <b>slow business months, economic recession, technical issues, or underperforming products</b>.</p>
