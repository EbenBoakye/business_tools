    <h2>How to Use The Compound Interest Calculator</h2>
    <div id="widget-container">
         <p>
            The Compound Interest Calculator is a tool designed to help you estimate the growth of your investments, saving or loans over time with compound interest. 
            Compound interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. 
            This calculator allows you to input the initial deposit, contribution amount, contribution frequency, years of growth, estimated rate of return, and compound frequency. 
            The calculator will then display the total balance, total investment, and total interest.
         </p>
            <h3> <b>Step 1: Enter Your Initial Deposit (£)</b></h3>
            <p>The initial deposit is the amount of money you are starting with. 
                This could be the amount you have saved or the amount you are investing. 
                Enter the initial deposit amount in the input field provided.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 2: Set Your Contribution Amount (£)</b></h3>
            <p>The contribution amount is the amount you plan to add to your investment or savings regularly. 
                This could be a monthly contribution, weekly contribution, or any other frequency. 
                Enter the contribution amount in the input field provided.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 3: Choose Your Contribution Frequency</b></h3>
            <p>Choose the frequency at which you plan to make contributions to your investment or savings. 
                This could be daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. 
                Select the contribution frequency from the dropdown menu provided.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 4: Enter the Number of Years You Plan to Grow Your Investment</b></h3>
            <p>Enter the number of years you plan to grow your investment or savings. 
                This will help calculate the compound interest over the specified period.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 5: Set Your Estimated Rate of Return (%)</b></h3>
            <p>The estimated rate of return is the percentage at which you expect your investment to grow annually. 
                This is the interest rate that will be applied to your investment. 
                Enter the estimated rate of return in the input field provided.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 6: Choose Your Compound Frequency</b></h3>
            <p>Choose the frequency at which the interest will be compounded. You are specifying how often you plan to make contribution. 
                This could be daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. 
                Select the compound frequency from the dropdown menu provided.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 7: Calculate Your Compound Interest</b></h3>
            <p>Click the "<i>Calculate</i>" button to calculate the total balance, total investment, and total interest based on the provided inputs. 
                The calculator will display the results in the output section.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 8: Download Your Compound Interest Chart</b></h3>
            <p>Click the "<i>Download</i>" button to download the compound interest chart as an image for your records or presentations.</p>
            <h3><b><u>Tips For Using The Calculator Effectively</u>:</b></h3>
            <p><b>Experiment with Different Scenarios:</b> Try entering different rates of return, contribution amounts, 
                or compounding frequencies to see how they impact your total balance over time.</p>
            <p><b>Use Realistic Rate of Return:</b>  Be sure to use a reasonable rate of return for your investment type.
                 For example, stock market investments typically yield higher returns but come with more risk, while savings accounts offer lower returns with more stability.
            </p>
            <p><b>Longer Time Periods Show Greater Impact:</b> Compound interest has a more dramatic effect over long time periods.
                 The calculator can help you see how much your investment can grow if you let it compound for many years.
